# Chat Item Tag

For mobile users who don't use mouse and keyboard, now you don't need to type [item tag format](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Chat#Tags) and remembering a whole lot of item id's to show an item inside chat box, you just need to type item name inside a square bracket `[ ]`. Example, try to type `[life crystal]` instead of `[i/s1:29]`
